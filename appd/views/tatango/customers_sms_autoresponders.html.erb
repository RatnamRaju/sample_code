							<h2>Pirq</h2>
							<p class="location">Seattle, WA</p>
							<p class="location">Industry: <a href="<%= url_for entertainment_sms_path %>" title="Entertainment">Entertainment</a></p>
							<p>
Haven’t heard about Pirq yet? It’s an awesome app that allows iPhone and Android users to discover local, quality offers from select dining establishments. While the Pirq app is extremely easy to use, downloading Pirq, or any mobile app for that matter from the app store isn’t exactly the easiest process.
							</p>
							<p>
Pirq came to Tatango with the challenge of making the app download process easier with text messaging. Tatango proposed that instead of forcing potential app downloaders to search through hundreds of thousands of apps, why not direct them right to the app itself. No distractions, no confusion, just downloads.
							</p>
							<p>
By using the Tatango SMS Autoresponder feature, they’re now able to send users directly to their app download. When someone texts PIRQ to 68398 on their mobile phone, they immediately receive a text message response with a link to the instant app download.

							<h2>- Apartment SMS</h2>

Pomeroy Court Apartments located near Western Washington University came to Tatango looking for a way to connect with potential student tenants. Being that university students are relying more and more on their mobile phones to hunt for a new apartment, the apartment complex built a new mobile website with photos, directions, availability and contact information. 
							</p>
							<p>
Pomeroy Court then needed a quick and easy way to direct students who were walking and driving by to visit their website on their mobile phones. At first, they told passerbys to enter a clunky URL into their mobile internet browsers, with little to no success. That's when they decided to give Tatango a shot and created an SMS Autoresponder, allowing passing students to request the URL to their mobile phones via a simple text message. This method was a drastic improvement, significantly increasing the amount of traffic to their mobile website and eventually leading to fewer apartment vacancies.
							</p>
							<p>
Tatango is the leader in apartment text messaging, helping apartment owners nationwide go mobile. Is your apartment complex using text messaging? If not, maybe it's time you give the awesome people at Tatango a call.

For apartment hunters, generating consistent, quality leads is critical in running a successful apartment hunting business. As any apartment hunter will tell you though, generating these consistent, quality leads is tough and can require a ton of work. 
							</p>
							<p>
Jeremy Ruth with Houston Modern Rentals knew this all too well. He came to Tatango looking not only for a way to take his apartment hunting business mobile, but to increase the amount of quality leads he received on a daily basis. To do this, Jeremy set up unique SMS Autoresponders for each and every property he had available. When a potential client viewed a property, they were encouraged to send a text message to get more information on the property. The result of a client interacting with one of his SMS Autoresponders is that customers' mobile phone numbers are captured and sent instantly to Jeremy's email address, allowing him to follow up with the potential clients on available properties in the area.
							</p>
							<p>
Apartment hunting can be a jungle and when it comes to navigating that jungle, Tatango knows apartment hunting text messaging better than any other services out there. Let us prove it to you, contact us today to discuss your real estate text messaging needs.
