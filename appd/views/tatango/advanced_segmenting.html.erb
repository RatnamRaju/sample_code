					<h1>Advanced SMS Subscriber Segmenting</h1>
					<img src="<%= asset_path 'enterprise-advanced_segmenting.jpg' %>" width="664" height="304" alt="Advanced SMS Subscriber Segmenting" />
					<p>
If you're looking to maximize the results of your SMS marketing campaign, there's no more effective method than to segment your mobile subscribers based on demographics, location, behavior or a custom variable defined by your business. Once mobile subscribers are segmented you're able to send highly targeted SMS promotions to exactly the right consumer, guaranteeing higher response rates. Learn more below about the different methods of segmenting your mobile subscriber list.
					</p>
					<h2>By Demographics</h2>
					<p>
Create advanced segments for your mobile subscribers on how they describe themselves. This could include age, gender, relationship status, income, purchasing habits or any other demographic information that would help you better target SMS promotions to your consumers. Create as many demographic segments with Tatango as you like, mix and match, the sky is the limit.
					</p>
					<h2>By Location</h2>
					<p>
Running a national SMS campaign, but want to localize each SMS promotion? By using Tatango advanced segments, you're able to collect location data about your SMS subscribers and target SMS promotions to designated areas or locations. Whether that means a specific zip code or an entire time zone, Tatango has you covered. 
					</p>
					<h2>By Behavior</h2>
					<p>
Take your SMS campaign to a whole new level by targeting specific SMS promotions to only your most active subscribers. Segment your SMS subscribers by opt-in date, the amount of times they've clicked on hyperlinks within messages or even by the types of interactions they've had with your campaign. The possibilities are endless when it comes to segmenting your subscribers by behavior.
					</p>
					<h2>By Custom Fields</h2>
					<p>
With custom fields, Tatango gives you the ability to segment your mobile subscriber list based on nearly anything you can dream up. Think about how cool it would be to create a custom field that captured a mobile subscribers birth date, allowing you to send a happy birthday text message to each of your mobile subscribers on their birthdays. Pretty cool huh?
